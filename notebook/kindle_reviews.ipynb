for example if it s a decent story but not technically all that well told i may give it a three star but explain in my review what the critical aspect are i understand and accept that i hold my favorite genre to a higher standard - rightly or wrongly - than other genre and that ultimately i want to be entertained i believe that if i m not entertained given that the genre predisposes me to being entertained then there s a big problem somewhere i wa not entertained by demonfire my apology to kate douglas who i ve enjoyed a an erotic paranormal romance author but frankly i found the character in demonfire to be two-dimensional and the narrative to be repetitive inexplicable and at time heavy-handed eddy and dax seemed cardboard and flat and unfortunately so did the entire impetus behind their relationship the abrupt way they were thrown together felt too contrived and put a heavy strain on my suspension of disbelief not even dax could understand how he got into eddy s shed from the portal he came through so how could i when those issue combined with the perplexing mythology of the lemurians to explain altan s character and presence the first quarter of the book felt like a cross between a snore and a quagmire of implausibility to be honest the pitbull poodle mixed-breed canine wa more fleshed out with a more believable and sympathetic backstory than two third of the book s main character and that s a problem dax is a former demon now reincarnated reanimated newly de-demonized-sorta former soldier boy with a tattoo on his body that will come back to bite him or try to again and again and again eddy is a human reporter who is willing to toss her job and fight demon she didn t even believe in yesterday no convincing and little to no explanation needed she find out her touch soothes dax s demonic curse with no explanation and little to no coherent reason given altan is the ancient lemurian who gave up his millennia-old and immortal life in the cavern of a currently inactive volcano or other dimension i wasn t too clear on that - could be both i suppose though i m not sure why the volcano would exist in both dimension the part of the story concerning that race and altan s decision wa anorexic in plot and very nebulous in the narrative and i had a big problem with altan s excellent grasp of modern american vernacular technology and cultural reference considering the written mythology toss in the dog bumper a will-o -wisp tinkerbell-sort willow my favorite character through most of the book and ed eddy s father by far the most interesting and believable character and you have the core group that fight the big bad demon who really aren t so big or bad given that they re animating garden gnome and other kitschy lawn statuary except for the gargoyle - but you ll have to read that for yourself the problem with the book aren t just in the character the world douglas is trying to create here never really snapped into solid focus for me too many shifting descriptives and inexplicable happenstance the book s main conflict the threat of the big bad and smaller baddie wa bizarrely non-threatening you could ve had a no human were hurt during the writing of this book disclaimer and then there wa the repetition dax wa given a human sorta body for one week to fight the demon slipping from abyss after the protagonist get together the book count down the rest of dax s seven day and at some point in each one of those remaining day the fact he s only got six five four three two day left is given a lot of room in the story to explain in mind-numbing detail just how sucky it is for all concerned that dax only ha that much time left and this melodrama went on each and every day over and over and over again repetitively i don t think that s compelling plot nor do i feel that it engenders any sense of true tension because a the reader i know going in that it s a paranormal romance and dax and eddy are going to get their hea otherwise it d be called shakespeare lamenting for page after page about them being separated for eternity just becomes tedious and dare i be repetitive repetitive i ve read excellent paranormal romance series that deal with this subject and it s always the ingenuity and originality of how the lead get their hea that impress me i already know they re going to so by the end when i wa at least hoping for a glimmer of originality in the way eddy and dax stay together i wa ultimately disappointed again i won t give spoiler but it wa just not well done so why the two star given how much it sound like i hated it because i didn t hate it maybe i wa too ambivalent about it to hate it maybe that s worse but mostly the two star are because there were a few tiny glimmer of hope kate douglas doe write reasonably sensual sex scene and what little chemistry there wa between dax and eddy shined brightest during them i think it s hard sometimes to go from writing erotic novel to toning down the sex for a mass market audience and i think that demonfire wa well represented in that regard i think some people are going to think it wa too graphic or explicit but i m not one of them i also sort of ended up liking altan i still don t get why he talked in such a modern and culturally human fashion but i thought he wa sort of endearing with the sword that refused to speak to him and the crush he get on ginny and that is why i will give kate douglas another chance the second book in this series is due out later this year and according to the sneak peak altan is off to sedona where he sent ginny to save her from what wa going on only to get a call that thing in sedona are even worse a live animal are being possessed by demon and attacking their owner and neighbor and the like and ginny is stubbornly aware of altan s machination with mind control despite altan s best effort i think it sound fun and ginny for her few minute of face time in the book struck me a a more layered and spunky character than eddy ever did i m looking forward to reading about them we ll see',\n",
